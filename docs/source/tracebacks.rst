Friendly error messages
=======================

AvantPy aims to provide friendlier feedback when an exception
is raised than what is done by Python.
Such feedback will also be available in languages other than English.

.. note::

     The content of this file is generated by running
     update_tb.py located in the ``dev_tools`` directory,
     which needs to be done explicitly.
