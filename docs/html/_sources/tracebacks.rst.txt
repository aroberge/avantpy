Friendly error messages
=======================

AvantPy aims to provide friendlier feedback when an exception is raised than what is
done by Python.
Such feedback will also be available in languages other than English.

.. note::

     The content of this file is generated by running
     update_tb.py located in the ``dev_tools`` directory,
     which needs to be done explicitly.

IfNobreakError
-------------- 

Example 1::

    AVANTPY EXCEPTION: IfNobreakError

    Error found in file ifnobreakerror.pyupper on line 4.

       2: if True:
       3:     pass
    -->4: NOBREAK:

    The AvantPy NOBREAK keyword cannot be used in an IF/ELIF/ELSE clause
    (Python: if/elif/else).
