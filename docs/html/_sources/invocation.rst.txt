Invocation
===========

If you cannot wait to try AvantPy before reading the rest of the documentation,
here's how you can do it::

    $ python -m avantpy -h
    usage: -m [-h] [-s SOURCE] [--lang LANG] [--dialect DIALECT] [--diff]
              [--dev_py] [--show_converted] [--transcode] [--from_path FROM_PATH]
              [--to_path TO_PATH]

    AvantPy sets up an import hook which makes it possible to run a file that
    contains modified Python syntax provided the relevant source transformers can
    be imported.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -s SOURCE, --source SOURCE
                            Source file to be transformed and executed. It is
                            assumed that it can be imported. Format: path.to.file
                            -- Do not include an extension.
      --lang LANG           This sets the language used by AvantPy. Usually this
                            is a two-letter code such as 'fr' for French. If no
                            dialect is specified, this will also sets the
                            corresponding dialect
      --dialect DIALECT     This sets the dialect used by AvantPy. Usually this is
                            a two-letter code such as 'pyfr' for French. If 'lang'
                            is not specified, this will also sets the
                            corresponding value for lang.
      --diff                Creates an html file containing a showing how the
                            original source differs from the transformed one,
                            opens a tab in the default browser showing this html
                            file, and exits without executing the code from the
                            source.
      --dev_py              This disables the custom exception handling so that
                            Python tracebacks are printed
      --show_converted      When using the console, if this flag is set, each time
                            the code entered is compaeed with the code
                            transformed. If the two are not identical, the
                            converted code is printed in the console.
      --transcode           Indicates that a file is to be transcoded from one
                            dialect to another. If -s or --source is specified,
                            this is ignored.
      --from_path FROM_PATH
                            This is used together with the --transcode option to
                            specify the relative path of the file to be
                            transcoded. The dialect is determined from the
                            extension.
      --to_path TO_PATH     This is used together with the --transcode option to
                            specify the relative path of the file to be
                            transcoded. The dialect is determined from the
                            extension.
