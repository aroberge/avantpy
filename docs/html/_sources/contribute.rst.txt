==================

.. note::

    This project uses `Black <https://github.com/ambv/black>`_ with default
    parameters for formatting. This means that some linter that strictly
    follow PEP 8 will give spurious warning messages.

Contributing through a pull request
------------------------------------

Before you think of writing code to be submitted as a pull request,
you **should** first file an issue about it.
If possible, create a separate branch identified with the issue number.
