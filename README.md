# AvantPy

Python with **training wheels**: _executable pseudocode_ in any language.

## Who is it for

AvantPy is designed with two similar target audiences:

- Non English speaking student who are learning programming for the first time in a classroom environment.
  Realistically, many of such students will never use programming immediately afterwards or perhaps never.
  However they likely would retain concepts better if they are learning them in their natural language.
- Beginning programmers who have only use block-based programming environments,
  such as [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) or
  [Blockly](https://blockly-games.appspot.com/),
  and wish to start using text-based programming environments.

### Executable pseudocode

Python is often described as executable pseudocode. Once people have learned a few idiomatic expressions, like `for variable in range(n)`, translating pseudocode written in English into Python is usually very straightforward.

If the pseudocode is not written in English, the translation process is, at least initially, not as straightforward as an additional mental step is required by the translation from the original language into Python's English. The small number of keyword in Python is a definite help in this process.

For absolute beginners who are learning programming concepts (control flow structures, defining functions, etc.), being able to use a language that uses keywords easily understood in their own language can definitely facilitate the learning process.
This is the approach taken by people using block-based environment
(Scratch, Blockly, etc.) developed by educational experts
to help students learn programming concepts.

## What is meant by training wheels

To help beginners learning how to ride a bicycle, one sometimes uses [training wheels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_wheels). After a while, the new cyclists ride
their bicycles without the training wheels needing to touch the ground to offer
additional support. This is similar to what AvantPy aims to do for learning Python.

Imagine that I am a French speaker that learns to program using AvantPy.
My first program might be:

```py
imprime("Bonjour !")
```

A while later, I might write a program like the following:

```py
si commande == 'q'
   imprime("Au revoir !")
```

When I would try to execute such a program, I would get the following error message:

```txt
Il y a une erreur de syntaxe dans ce programme dans la ligne contenant le code suivant:

    si commande == 'q'

Une instruction d√©butant avec le mot "si" doit terminer par deux points (:).
[Voir documentation-si.]
```

The equivalent English version would be

```txt
There is a syntax error in this program at the line containing the following code:

    if commande == 'q'

A statement beginning with the word "if" must end with a colon (:).
[Relevant link to the documentation on "if" provided here.]
```

Eventually, I might want to learn some "true" Python code.
Along the way, I would make use of a tool provided to show me the
true Python code corresponding to the code written in my given dialect:

```py
if commande == 'q':        # si commande == 'q':
    print("Au revoir !")   #     imprime("Au revoir !")
```

and feel ready to leave AvantPy and only write Python.

## What is included

:warning: The following describes what the final version of AvantPy should look
like; currently, much remains to be implemented.

- AvantPy is a collection of dialects, each dialect being a superset of Python, designed to make it easier to learn programming concepts in a given human language.
  - Each dialect consists of a translations of most Python keywords in a given human language, supplemented by a few additional constructs intended to make some concepts easier to learn.
    - The additional constructs are strongly inspired by some choices made
      in Scratch and Blockly.
  - The current version includes three dialects: English, French and Spanish.
- AvantPy is a preprocessor, that takes a program written either totally or
in parts in a given dialect, and converts it to standard Python prior to execution.
  - A syntactically valid program can include a mix of code written in normal Python and in a specific dialect. This is to ease the transition to learning Python.
- AvantPy also includes tools to analyze Python tracebacks and translate them into easier to understand feedback for beginners.
  - **This is not yet implemented**
- AvantPy is written as a standard Python module/package meant to be usable with any "normal" Python environment. Thus, it could be included as a plugin for a given
editor, or run with a standard Python interpreter from the command line.
- AvantPy also includes a tool to convert programs written in a given dialect into standard Python, showing the differences between the two, thus helping motivated users to make the transition to using only standard Python.
  - A rough implementation of this idea exists as a **debug** mode.
- AvantPy also includes a custom REPL.
