# Survivor bias: an anecdote

When a new feature for a programming language is proposed to make a concepts
easier to learn by beginners, I often read comments like
"_It is not needed as I learned X perfectly well without this feature_"
or "_I teach X as is and my students do not need this feature to learn programming._"

I see this as a typical example of
[survivor bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias).

I'm reminded of a (teaching award ceremony I attended in 2008)[http://www.atlanticuniversities.ca/sites/default/files/documents/AAUTeachingAwards/AAUDistinguishedTeachingCitations/2008%20VanBommel%20Citation.pdf] where, during the introduction
of one of the recipients, it was mentioned:


> _While he teaches at all levels,
> Martin is particularly associated with the first year programming class,
> a course he has taught for ten years._

The computer language taught to beginners by
[Dr. Martin van Bommel](http://people.stfx.ca/mvanbomm/) was
[C++](http://people.stfx.ca/mvanbomm/cs161/).

Having listened to Dr. van Bommel presentation and talked to him afterwards,
I have no doubt that he was very much deserving of the teaching award he received;
having met him only once and remembering his presentation 10 years later is
a clear sign that he made quite a positive impression.

Yet, in spite of Dr. van Bommel's opinion expressed to me at the time,
I am not convinced at all that C++ is objectively a better language than Python
(or Racket, Scratch, etc.) to teach computer programming concepts to beginners;
in fact, I am convinced that the opposite is true. Admitedly, this is
just a personal opinion, but one that seems to be shared by many people.

It should be noted that awards given for teaching are often based on the submission of a teaching
dossier that included student evaluations including comments provided by
students and colleagues. What they do not typically include is any information about
students having abandoned a course as they found it too
difficult: teaching dossiers often give an incomplete picture as a
result of survivor bias. However, since **all** teaching dossiers likely suffer
from the selectivity resulting from survivor bias, they still can be an
important tool in identifying who might be more deserving of an award.
Comparing teaching dossiers might give us some information as to how Dr. van Bommel is
perceived as a teacher compared with other colleagues, but they give us no
information as to how C++ compares with other programming languages as a
first language to learn programming concepts.

All that being said, while I think that Python is an excellent choice for teaching
programming to beginners, I believe that it could be improved for that purpose.
I also believe that many potential improvements do not need to be part of
the core language, but only available as temporary aids during the
learning process. While I learned perfectly well using standard Python,
it does not mean that my learning experience could not have been improved upon.
