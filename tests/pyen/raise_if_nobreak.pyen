'''Testing nobreak keyword with if.

`nobreak` can replace `else` for loops (`for` and `while`) but not for `if` blocks.

'''

# AvantPy will abort the transformations when a user writes
# an if/nobreak statement instead of if/else.  It replaces
# the nobreak statement by a raise SyntaxError and stops
# processing the file.

# If you want to see what happens to this file, instead of
#    python -m avantpy -s tests.if_nobreak
# try
#    python -m avantpy -s tests.if_nobreak--diff


def test_if_nobreak():
    if True:
        pass
    nobreak:  # AvantPy stops here
        pass 

# Nothing below the nobreak statement matching an if block is processed by AvantPy
